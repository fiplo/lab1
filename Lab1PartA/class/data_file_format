Every file parsed by this program is broken up into tokens. Each token is one of
the following:

	1. An Alphanumeric string with underscores.
	2. A number (either integer or floating point).
	3. A string between double quotes.
	4. Any character that is not white space, a letter or digit.

A consequence of this is that white space becomes insignificant when it comes to
parsing a data file.

Resident file format:

	(lastName ',' adress (',' month ',' code ',' amount)+ ';')*

	lastName 	- string (either between quotes or as a single word).
	adress 		- same as last name.
	month 		- integer between 1 and 12 inclusive.
	code 		- integer
	amont 		- real number.

Utility file format:

	(code ',' name ',' monthlyPrice ';')*

	code 		- integer
	name 		- string (either integer or between double quotes)
	monthlyPrice 	- real number
